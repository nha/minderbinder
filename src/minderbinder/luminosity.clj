  ;; Luminous intensity in a given direction of a source which
  ;; emits monochromatic radiation at 540e12 Hz with radiant
  ;; intensity 1|683 W/steradian.  (This differs from radiant
  ;; intensity (W/sr) in that it is adjusted for human
  ;; perceptual dependence on wavelength.  The frequency of
  ;; 540e12 Hz (yellow) is where human perception is most
  ;; efficient.)
