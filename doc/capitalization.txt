Rules for how to capitalize SI unit abbreviations:

* Symbols for units not named after people (e.g., the hour in the kWh) are written in lower case.

* Symbols for units named after people (e.g., the "W" which is the watt, named after James Watt of steam engine fame) are written in initial capitals.

* Prefixes for multipliers of 1 000 and smaller (i.e., "k" for kilo-, "h" for hecto-, "da" for deca- and all the prefixes for multipliers smaller than one) are written in lower case.

* Prefixes for multipliers of 1 000 000 and greater (e.g., "M" for mega-, "G" for giga-) are written in initial capitals.
